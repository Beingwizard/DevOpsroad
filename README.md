It's just a fun stuff, that I'm gonna do as a weekend project, so please don't take me seriously. I believe it's fun when you figure out your own path, this can't be the best way but I like this one so it's fine if you don't like this.I hope you'll also find a way to know what you actually like and how you should actually learn :)
